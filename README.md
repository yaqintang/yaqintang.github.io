I create this page to serve as a hub to archive my notes and writings. All the information is to the best of my knowledge, and I'm trying to make it clear, accurate and informative.

The code is open source and I would like to acknowledge the help of countless online tutorials, tech blogs and more. Unless otherwise stated, all content is under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).
