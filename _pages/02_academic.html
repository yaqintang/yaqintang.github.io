I received my M.S. under the guidance of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~gruteser/">Prof. Marco Gruteser</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/">WINLAB</a>/<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/">ECE</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a> in 2015.
I learned and focused on mobile computing, visible light commucation and computer vision.
<br>
I also received B.E. from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scie.uestc.edu.cn/">School of Communication and Information Engineering</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://en.uestc.edu.cn/">UESTC</a> in 2013.
I spent some time with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asr.org/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=35&id=434">Prof. Gang Feng</a>, doing projects on sensor networks and computer communications.

<h3>Visual MIMO - flicker free screen camera communication</h3>
<div class="projectscontainer">

		</div>
		<div class="introduce">
		<p>Visual MIMO is based on multiple light emitting arrays and photodiode arrays in visible light communication. Challenged in both user experience and system goodput (accuracy and throughput), we explored factors contributing to screen flicker perception, designed a screen-camera communication system with content-adaptive embedding method to achieve flicker free and high goodput results.

<h3>Indoor Localization with Hybrid Radio-Optical Tags</h3>
<div class="projectscontainer">
		<div class="photo">
			<img class="imgproject" src="/images/localization.jpg" />
		</div>
		<div class="introduce">
		<p>Motivated to achieve high accuracy and low energy consumption for indoor localization, we designed a InfraRad system that uses hybrid radio-optical technique. From triangulation, localization can be achieved if knowing some angles or lateral length.
		</p>
		<p><b>My contributions are:</b></p>
		<p>
			<li>
				proposed the algorithm for the receiver to do localization;
			</li>
			<li>
				designed the strategies for our system deployment in the competition evaluation area.
			</li>
			I worked with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ashwina/">Ashwin Ashok</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chenren/">Chenren Xu</a> for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/event/microsoft-indoor-localization-competition-ipsn-2014/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fevents%2Fipsn2014indoorlocalizatinocompetition%2F">Microsoft indoor localization competition - IPSN 2014</a>. Our system is demonstrated using a receiver apparatus where the radio-IR receiver with an array of photodiodes is mounted onto eyeglasses.

<h3>Human Gesture Identification using Capacitive Sensing</h3>
<div class="projectscontainer">
		<div class="photo">
			<img class="imgproject" src="/images/capacitive.jpg" />
		</div>
		<div class="introduce">
		<p>To enhance conventional touchscreen user interaction scenarios, there's a novel Swept Frequency Capacitive Sensing technique - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/project/touche-touch-and-gesture-sensing-for-the-real-world/">"Touche"</a>, which provides rich touch and gesture sensitivity to a variety of analog and digital objects. This method is realized by checking the capacitance change in the circuit because of body movement, then classify the signal response into different category. There're applications, such as security password, remote control etc.

		<p><b>My contributions are:</b></p>
		<p>
			<li>
				Duplicated the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/project/touche-touch-and-gesture-sensing-for-the-real-world/">Touche</a> work with launchpad <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-exp430g2">MSP-EXP430G2</a> and built surrounding circuit on breadboard;

			<li>
				Completed firmware programming for the system.

<h3>Localization using Smartphone Camera</h3>
<div class="projectscontainer">
		<div class="photo">
			<img class="imgproject" src="/images/localPhone.jpg" />
		</div>
		<div class="introduce">
		<p>Challenged by low GPS accuracy in dense urban areas, we need to find out new solutions to improve localization accuracy. In general, we propose a system with precise localization by using smartphone cameras capturing its surrounding scenery and take a match with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/streetview/">Google Street View</a> images.
