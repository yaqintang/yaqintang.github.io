		<td>
			Visual MIMO is based on multiple light emitting arrays and photodiode arrays in visible light communication. Challenged in both user experience and system goodput (accuracy and throughput), we explored factors contributing to screen flicker perception, designed a screen-camera communication system with content-adaptive embedding method to achieve flicker free and high goodput results.

			Motivated to achieve high accuracy and low energy consumption for indoor localization, we designed a InfraRad system that uses hybrid radio-optical technique. From triangulation, localization can be achieved if knowing some angles or lateral length.

			To enhance conventional touchscreen user interaction scenarios, there's a novel Swept Frequency Capacitive Sensing technique - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/project/touche-touch-and-gesture-sensing-for-the-real-world/">"Touche"</a>, which provides rich touch and gesture sensitivity to a variety of analog and digital objects. This method is realized by checking the capacitance change in the circuit because of body movement, then classify the signal response into different category. There're applications, such as security password, remote control etc.
